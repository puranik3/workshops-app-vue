      <h1>Workshops App</h1>
      <p>
        The Workshops application serves details of (fictitious) technical workshops happening in various cities. Every workshop has a broad topic (eg. JavaScript), and a workshop has many sessions (each session covers a sub-topic, eg. Closures in JavaScript).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can view a list of workshops, details of every workshop, sessions in a workshop, and also add a new session for a workshop.
